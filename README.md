Solutions to coding challenges from Cracking The Coding Interview book

This repository is an attempt to review & refresh my knowledge in algorithms & data structures. 
It is also suprisingly valueble in increasing my ruby "erudition".

There are a lot of sites like InterviewBit or Hackerrank which provide tooling for coding challenges: 
extensive output validation, benchmarking, boilerplates, timing and gamification. I also use them, but
for some tasks I prefer just a local environment, because I can "communicate" my thinking by
writing a description of expected solutions, making notes for possible questions and edge cases. 
All this without having sometimes stressfully ticking timer :)
